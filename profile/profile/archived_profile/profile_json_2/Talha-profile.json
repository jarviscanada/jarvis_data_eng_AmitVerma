    "summary": "Hi there! I am a York University alumni with a BSc Honours Degree in Computer Science. I am passionate and dedicate my unwavering commitment to whatever I set my mind to. As a result, I have been able to sharpen my work ethic to reflect the person that I am. I am a hard working, reliable, and trustworthy individual who is trying to improve every single day. Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball with my team in our local Ahmadiyya Basketball League (ABL). I also had the pleasure of serving as President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Students' Association (AMSA) at York University during my third and fourth years after I was elected by over 200 members. Now as an alumni, I continue to remain involved in our local community. Currently I am working and building upon my skills and experience with Jarvis as a Data Engineer Associate so I can continue to learn and grow within the Software industry.\n",
