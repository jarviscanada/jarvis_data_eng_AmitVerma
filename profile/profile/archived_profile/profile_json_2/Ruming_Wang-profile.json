    "summary": "I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a major in Computer Science. I have always been passionate about the technology industry, where breaking new ground, growth, and making creative ideas come true happens every day. I have been able to carry on my passion in the form of creating various apps, and join in multiple developing clubs where I could utilize my critical thinking, leadership, and algorithmic skills which I gained during my undergraduate studies. During my leisure, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and volunteering at local high schools as a teaching assistant or participate in events that are dedicated to helping international students to have a smooth transition from high school into University in a foreign country. By doing this not only can I help others but also develop my communication and interpersonal skills. This is one of the most valued experiences during my study at the University of Toronto.\n",
