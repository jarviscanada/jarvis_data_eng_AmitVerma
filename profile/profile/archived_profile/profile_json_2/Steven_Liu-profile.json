    "summary": "Problem solver, culture explorer, lifelong learner. Before joining Jarvis, I graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with an Honors B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Statistics. The blend of academic training has given me both solid coding and analytical skills. I found my interest in data engineering in my final year of university, which is a discipline that includes all the exciting things I am passionate about. I look forward to opportunities to utilize and develop my skills from Jarvis' clients in Toronto.\n",
