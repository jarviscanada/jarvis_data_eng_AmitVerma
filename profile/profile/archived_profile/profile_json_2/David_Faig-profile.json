    "summary": "I have a background in math and computer science, but I prefer my work to be writing code rather than writing about code. Jarvis placed me in CIBC as a developer, and I've been working on a large project with them for the past year. I get a lot of experience working in a fairly large agile team, though we do have to make some concessions on the \"agile\" part. Fortunately I get to work along side a lot of the Jarvis associates that I trained with",
