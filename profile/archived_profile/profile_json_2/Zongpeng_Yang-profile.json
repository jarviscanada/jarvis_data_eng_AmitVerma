    "summary": "I recently graduated from Queen's University with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Science in Engineering Physics. I chose to move halfway across the globe from China to Kingston, Ontario to pursue a career in engineering. During the last year of University, I found my interest in Computer Science which is when I decided to enroll in basic CS courses and eventually found myself pursuing a second degree in computer science. I am passionate about learning new technology software as well as applying new and developed skillsets. Additionally, I also love to partake in competitive video games with friends all over the country. In totality, I am excited to pursue a career in data engineering to further develop my skills and hone in on that which I am passionate about.\n",
