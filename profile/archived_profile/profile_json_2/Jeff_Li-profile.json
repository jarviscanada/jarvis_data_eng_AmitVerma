    "summary": "I am a graduate of the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The whole reason I am interested in Computer Science, in general, is the fact that there is such a wide application of the profession. I have experience working in agile scrum teams both as a developer and a QA. Outside of work, I have an interest in Gaming, Game Design, Reading, as well as history. What makes me enthusiastic about working in data engineering is that only for the past few decades does there exist recorded data that can be used in the way of \"data engineering\" making this a new and interesting frontier that I am interested in being a part of.",
