Steven Liu,"Problem solver, culture explorer, lifelong learner. Before joining Jarvis, I graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with an Honors B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Statistics. The blend of academic training has given me both solid coding and analytical skills. I found my interest in data engineering in my final year of university, which is a discipline that includes all the exciting things I am passionate about. I look forward to opportunities to utilize and develop my skills from Jarvis' clients in Toronto.

Artem Anosov,"I am a recent graduate from the University of Manitoba where I majored in Computer Science. Throughout my studies, I enjoyed learning software development and databases most. As for programming languages, Java is my favorite which is what I used in most assignments and projects, due to its OOP nature. Although I love learning, I also love implementing it. As a result, I was involved in different group projects in school, the biggest one was developing the website in a group of four people. It was very interesting and provided me with tons of valuable knowledge. During this phase of my life, I also learned more about my hobbies which include going to the gym, traveling, playing soccer, ping pong, and pool. Outside of my academic responsibilities, I also worked as a grocery/drugstore stock associate and a cashier at London Drugs. This opportunity, allowed me to improve my communicational and multitasking skills. In addition to that, it also taught me the importance of finding a work-life balance that I am now able to skillfully employ in my role and experiences here at Jarvis.

David Yang,"I am a graduate from the University of Toronto with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Professionally, I have had the opportunity to take on a few months of software work experience writing perl, python & tcl scripts to automate and report data in human readable tables and graphs. With automation, I was able to cut time spent on analyzing data by more than half. In addition to work experience, I enjoyed topics related to big data in school - my favorites being deep learning and databases. Outside of work I enjoy playing badminton and simulation video games. One game I enjoy in particular is City Skylines as I enjoy creating custom maps as well as testing other people's mods and others via Steam workshop. This hobby has instilled in me an appreciation for developers who provide good documentation for others to understand how to apply their work.

Mathew Vassair,"I graduated from a joint program between Brock University and Sheridan College, Computing and Network Communications. This program covered programming theory, practical applications, computer networking concepts and applications, and systems design. Between my education and my varied co-op experiences, I have built up a wide knowledge base and learned how to quickly teach myself new concepts, which I believe makes me a perfect fit for the Data Engineering industry. I'm also interested in the potential crossover between Data Engineering and other fields, both inside and outside the IT sphere, since a little external domain knowledge can go a long way in creating new solutions. Outside of Data Engineering, I enjoy photography, hiking, playing online games, and video game speedrunning.
