summary: Hi! I'm Amit Verma, a results-driven Software Engineer based in Toronto, Canada. With a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Western Ontario, I bring a solid academic foundation and hands-on experience in front-end technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and back-end technologies such as Node.js, .NET Core, and PostgreSQL. I started my software journey by hacking together python scripts to make my summer job as an assistant easier. As a Software Developer at Geotab Inc, I enhanced operating efficiency and user engagement by implementing full-stack solutions and spearheading the design of 50+ features. In pursuit of a Software Developer role, I am eager to contribute my technical skills, collaborative mindset, and innovative problem-solving abilities. I am confident that my blend of technical acumen and dedication makes me an ideal candidate for driving success in software development endeavors.
